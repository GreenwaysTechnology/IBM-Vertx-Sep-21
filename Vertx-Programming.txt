2.kernal space


What is file Descriptor?

 -It is data structure - located inside kernal
 -It is created per process for eg for jvm , there will be one file descriptor.

Why file descriptor?
  
  Which is the bridge between application process and hardware layer.

Application process - could be any runtime - jvm,clr,anyruntime

Two types of api

1.high level api - java api
 
FileInputStream fs = new FileInputStream(new File("foo.txt"));

somecode
while((char c=rs.read()) {
   print c;
}
some code

2.low level api - c

System call - os call
  read()

.............................................................................................

Blocking IO: 

 The application cant do any process until io operation is completed

while((char c=rs.read()) {
   print c;
}
some code
 here blocking io code, "some code" will not run until while loop terminates : Blocking IO

Request per thread - for every request a new thread is created.

1000 request = 1000 threads

This arch introduced in 1995.

Draback of request per thread model.

In 2000, the problem was identifed----more request more thread

When a thread is created
 - it requires some memory
 - if thread is not in use for some time, cpu will put the thread in sleep state
    if data ready, the os will put thread in active state  :Ctx switch.

C10K Problem

linux apis

 blocking api              non blocking api(2000)
  read                       select


Non blocking socket api

select - to return control from the fsd
read -- to read ready data  from the kernal buffer.
